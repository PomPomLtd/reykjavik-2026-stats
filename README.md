git pull

# Generate season overview (local, fast)
node scripts/generate-overview.js --season 46
```

- No need to download PGNs manually
- No need to keep laptop running
- Automatic commit and Vercel deployment
- See **REMOTE_ANALYSIS.md** for details

#### Option 2: Local Analysis

Complete workflow for generating statistics locally:

```bash
# 1. Fetch season data from Lichess 4545
node scripts/fetch-lichess-season.js --season=46

# 2. Download PGNs for a round
node scripts/download-pgns.js --season=46 --round=1

# 3. Generate round statistics (with Stockfish analysis)
cat data/season-46-round-1.pgn | \
  node scripts/generate-stats.js --round 1 --season 46 --analyze --depth 15
